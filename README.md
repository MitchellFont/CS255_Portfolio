Business Requirements Document and System Design Document created as projects for CS255 Systems Analysis and Design

-Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

   Our client DriverPass wanted a learning platform system that their users could utilize to help pass their DMV Licensing Tests. In addition to online learning content, DriverPass wanted us to create a system for scheduling driving appointments for in person driving lessons.

-What did you do particularly well?

  I flet like my Systems Design Document was very good but I was proud of the work put into the UML Activity Diagrams I created. This was my first time creating these and I enjoyed learning how to create them and when each type is needed.

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  Although I am very proud of the UMl Class Diagram I created, I fell like it could still use some improving.

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  As the primary individuals using this system, it is important to make sure user's have an acceptable experience. If the User has an issue with the system they may get frustrated and cancel their membership to DriverPass and blame our client for the issue, reducing our clients revenue.

-How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I would incorporate the AGILE methodology in my designing of software. I would also use the SDLC to help gather requirements based on user stories, plan a roadmap by creating data flow diagrams, and Object UML charts, develop these stories into functionality using a Test-Driven Development approach, and deploy and maintain the product with a strategic integration plan.
